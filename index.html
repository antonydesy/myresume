          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>After a distinguished career in journalism and customer service, I'm ready
             to make a career change into web development & web content production. I learned
              the fundamentals of web development standards and best practices, including
              web accessibility & internationalization, from the creator of the web,
               the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), in partnership with Microsoft. Please see below my level of expertise.</p>

          <h3>Ping-pong Challenge</h3>
          <p>I consider playing ping-pong to be one of my best skills. I started playing when I was eight years old in Cameroon,
             Africa. We played ping-pong without a ping-pong table nor racket as we couldn't afford to buy one. But we called it
             "ping-pong" anyway.  Years later, when I finally played "real ping-pong" with a table and racket, I was amazed at how
              good I was at this game. It gives me so much joy! If you want to get the best out of me at work, all you have to do is
              to install a ping-pong table in the workplace. And Voil√†!</p>
